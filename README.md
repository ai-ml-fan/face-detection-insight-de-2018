# Face-Detection Insight-DE-2018

## Facial Recognition at Scale for PEX


  PEX.com is an internet video analytics company. Pex aims to build the most advanced video & music analytics platform on the Internet.

## Background

With over 7 billion video/audio files indexed and classified, and over 1 exabyte of data processed, PEX aims to build useful insights to create a meaningful and actionable suite of analytics products. 

For this project, PEX wants to know when and how human faces appear in each video. This data will be used to enhance their dataset for analytics tools.

### Size of Dataset

50 TB of structured video, audio, and social media data, including links to media files, and associated metadata. 
  
Data will be provided either through access to Postgres tables, or http links, or access to Google Cloud storage buckets.

### Scope of Project : 
  1.  Build a scalable pipeline that processes the videos provided and computes video features such as intensities, labels, duration and other relevant metadata.
  2.  Determine the faces across all the video frames of each video using the appropriate facial detection algorithms.
  3. Design and define the schema to persist the computed data. 
  4. Provide access APIs to retrieve and possibly updated the persisted data.
  5. Extensions to this project would be to have a streaming algorithm to process videos in real-time.

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

# Face-Detection Insight-DE-2018
Facial Recognition at Scale 
Project Description
Introduction :
  Pex aims to build the most advanced video & music analytics platform on the Internet.

With over 7 billion video/audio files indexed and classified, and over 1 exabyte of data processed, PEX aims to build useful insights to create a meaningful and actionable suite of analytics products. For this project, PEX wants to know when and how human faces appear in each video. This data will be used to enhance their dataset for analytics tools.

Size of Dataset :
  50 TB of structured video, audio, and social media data, including links to media files, and associated metadata. 
  
  Data will be provided either through access to Postgres tables, or http links, or access to Google Cloud storage buckets.

Scope of Project : 
  Build a scalable pipeline that processes the videos and computes video features such as intensities, labels, duration and other relevant metadata. In addition to the metadata, determine the faces across all the video frames of each video using the appropriate facial recognition algorithms. Design and define the schema to persist the computed data. Provide access APIs to retrieve and possibly updated the persisted data.
  Extensions to this project would be to have a streaming algorithm to process videos in real-time.
